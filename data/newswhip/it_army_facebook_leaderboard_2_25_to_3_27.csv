2022-02-27T12:41:51,Ukraine Official Urges 'IT Army' of World's Digital Talent To Attack Russian Energy and Financial Firms - Slashdot,"VentureBeat reports:

In Ukraine today, Mykhailo Fedorov, the country's vice prime minister, announced on Twitter, ""We are creating an IT army.""

""We need digital talents,"" wrote Fedorov, who also holds the title of minister of digital transformation ‚Äî sharing a link to a Telegram channel where he said operational tasks will be distributed. ""We continue to fight on the cyber front."" On the Telegram channel, the IT army reportedly posted its list of Russian targets ‚Äî which were also translated into English ""for all IT specialists from other countries....""

On Friday, Christian Sorensen, a former U.S. Cyber Command official, told VentureBeat that ""hacktivists around the world [will be] working against Russia, because they are the aggressor.... I think things will ramp up against western targets, but Russia and Belarus will be targeted by these groups even more"" said Sorensen, formerly the operational planning team lead for the U.S. Cyber Command....

[O]n Friday, a Bloomberg report said that a hacker group that was now forming to bring counterattacks against Russia had amassed 500 members. And today, we have the announcement of Ukraine's IT army ‚Äî potentially including assistance from hackers around the globe. ""Whether sanctioned or not, official or not, if people have or can get the right information, know-how, and desire ‚Äî they can make an impact,"" Sorensen said on Friday, prior to the announcement of Ukraine's IT army. ""We'll have to wait and see what they are able to do.""

The next day Reuters reported that the official website of the Kremlin, ""the office of Russian President Vladimir Putin....was down on Saturday, following reports of denial of service (DDoS) attacks on various other Russian government and state media websites.

""The outages came as Ukraine's vice prime minister said it had launched an 'IT army' to combat Russia in cyberspace.""

But the Independent reports that the cyberattacks may have been even more extensive:

Ukraine's state telecommunications agency announced on Saturday that six Russian government websites, inclduing the Kremlin's, were down, according to The Kyiv Independent.

The agency also stated that the Russian media regulator's website had gone down, and that hackers had got Russian TV channels to play the Ukrainian music.

2022-02-28T12:40:31,Russian Government Sites Facing 'Unprecedented' Cyberattacks from Thousands in Pro-Ukranian 'IT Army' - Slashdot,"Though the Russian government has tried geofencing access to crucial web sites, the Jerusalem Post reports that two Russian government web site still went offline Saturday ‚Äî the Kremlin and the Ministry of Defense. ""Gosuslugi, Russia's web portal of state services, went offline on Saturday night as well, with the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media telling TASS that the site is facing cyberattacks on an 'unprecedented scale.'""

Meanwhile, the Washington Post interviews 22-year-old Alex Horlan, a Ukrainian cybersecurity expert in Spain ""helping take down some of Russia's most powerful websites ‚Äî including state media and even the official page of the Kremlin.""

The attacks he and others are helping to carry out on Russian websites are part of a wide information war in the background of the much larger conflict here, as Ukrainians target Russian websites to rewrite the narrative Moscow is presenting to Russians back home. ""We are creating an IT army,"" Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov tweeted on Saturday. Horlan is a cybersecurity expert who recently launched an app called disBalancer that helps take down scam websites by overwhelming them with online traffic. He has redirected his team's efforts in recent days to instead target Russian websites he says are spreading dangerous disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine....

Thousands of people are joining Horlan and others' efforts to target the Russian sites, with around 2,000 logging into his app at any given time, he said. The main challenge is that many are losing WiFi when air raid sirens force them to retreat to underground bunkers....

Volunteers are gathering information on attacks and casualties to fact check and challenge Russia's version of events, posting messages on Telegram and other Russian social media platforms [according to Liuba Tsbulska, a Ukrainian analyst and activist who has tracked Russian disinformation for eight year]. Others work to educate international audiences or produce patriotic content. Some also target Russian military and intelligence officers, flooding their emails and other platforms with messages. Volunteers are reaching out to the mothers of Russian soldiers to convince them to call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring their boys back home.

In Kharkiv, after reports that Russian troops and armored vehicles entered Ukraine's second largest city early Sunday, one local Telegram channel with more than 400,000 subscribers urged people to continue to document the adversary's movements as a way to aid Ukraine's forces in the area. In one message, the Truha Kharkiv channel asked citizens to ""carefully film and send information about the movement of Russian troops to our channel. This is vital to the defense of our city.""

Another message instructed citizens on how to make molotov cocktails.

2022-03-02T03:15:30,the art of non-conformity blog - How Ukraine Will Win the War üá∫üá¶,"Just in case you missed the news, a war started in Europe last week. Or to be precise, some people from an aggressive country (Russia) attacked all the people in a peaceful one (Ukraine).

Why should you care? I‚Äôll get to that, but first consider one of the most remarkable facts about this whole thing: the underdog is winning.

Ukraine, hugely outnumbered and invaded by a dominant outsider, lacks every advantage‚Äîyet they‚Äôre putting up an incredible fight!

To be clear, they might not win right away, or even at all. Russia has superior air power and a much larger military all around. Ukraine has less than a third of the population size and just 10% of GDP. Financially speaking, Russia‚Äôs budget has clear priorities: after the oligarchs get paid, put the rest towards creating chaos.

Also, ‚Äúwinning‚Äù a war never comes without great cost. If you could choose between winning and never having the war in the first place, only a dictator or a fool would choose war.

So it‚Äôs tough, in other words. Still, so far we have a far greater resistance than anyone expected. The president, who prior to his current job won competitions on Dancing with the Stars, seems to have met the moment.

You may have heard about the Ukrainians holding their ground against a Russian warship, willing to die rather than surrender. It‚Äôs truly an inspiring story, and one that I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll forget for a long time.

But did you hear about:

* The all-volunteer ‚ÄúIT army of Ukraine‚Äù launching coordinated cyber attacks on Russia 

* The mothers making molotov cocktails (an apocalyptic version of the Tupperware party)

* The 25,000 rifles given out to anyone who shows up, including 60-year-old farmers who want to defend their homeland

* Ukrainian women matching with Russian soldiers on Tinder, then exposing their positions while telling them off

I‚Äôm telling you, the resistance is real! And good for them. 

Whatever happens next, I really, really hope their struggle and sacrifice is not in vain. A few weeks ago, I would have said, ‚ÄúShit, this is terrible but who‚Äôs going to stop Russia? Not the U.S., and there‚Äôs no one else in the region willing to step up‚Äîso it‚Äôs a lost cause.‚Äù

But not so! At least not right away. Once in a while the underdog puts up an incredible fight. And this fierce resistance has allowed time for lots of other governments and actors to step up, from Germany to the Polish soccer team.

***

I totally understand why you might not want to pay attention.

Really, I get it. Bad things happen every day, somewhere in the world. As they say, if you aren‚Äôt outraged, you aren‚Äôt paying attention‚Äîbut you can‚Äôt pay attention to everything, or else you‚Äôll always be outraged.

Sensory overload is real, and I appreciate the stoic principle of not stressing out about all the things you can‚Äôt control.

But there‚Äôs also a risk that comes from tuning out completely.

When Russia invaded Ukraine last week‚Äîas if anyone had any doubt that they would‚Äîit really could have gone another way. I would not have been shocked if they‚Äôd rolled right in, captured Kyiv and other cities, and prepared to settle in as an occupying power. After all, that‚Äôs what Russia itself was expecting.

But look, Ukraine fought back! Average citizens are even willing to die for it. How could you not find this admirable?

So that‚Äôs why you have to care; you have to believe in something. To not care is to dehumanize.

When I wrote about the 2020 U.S. election, it created a firestorm in my inbox, the likes of which I hadn‚Äôt seen in years. I received hundreds of replies, probably 70-30 in favor but definitely a lot that were strongly opposed.

Over the following week more than 2,000 people unsubscribed. (Life goes on. For anyone who says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about politics,‚Äù I always think ‚ÄúBut everything is political.‚Äù)

One of my favorite replies came from a reader who passed on this Jewish dictum: ‚ÄúEven though we cannot solve a problem, we are not free to desist from trying.‚Äù

I liked that a lot and have thought about it many times since. You gotta try, regardless of outcome.

So if nothing else, let‚Äôs follow along, do anything we can to help, and hope for the best. As I said, the short-term scenario isn‚Äôt great‚ÄîRussia really is a superior military force, and Putin doesn‚Äôt care about who gets hurt along the way. Even so, the underdog is stepping up! Maybe the rest of us can learn something from them.

Go Ukraine! üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶

2022-03-07T15:30:19,The Invisible Battlefields Of The Russia-Ukraine War,"Early in the morning of February 24th, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at California‚Äôs Middlebury Institute of International Studies watched Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine unfold in realtime with troop movements overlaid atop high-resolution satellite imagery. This wasn‚Äôt privileged information ‚Äî anybody with an internet connection could access it, if they knew where to look. He was watching a traffic jam on Google Maps slowly inch towards and across the Russia-Ukraine border.

As he watched the invasion begin along with the rest of the world, another, less-visible facet of the emerging war was beginning to unfold on an ill-defined online battlefield. Digital espionage, social media and online surveillance have become indispensable instruments in the tool chest of a modern army, and both sides of the conflict have been putting these tools to use. Combined with civilian access to information unlike the world has ever seen before, this promises to be a war like no other.

Modern Cyberwarfare

The first casualties in the online component of the war have been websites. Two weeks ago, before the invasion began en masse, Russian cyberwarfare agents launched distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against Ukrainian government and financial websites. Subsequent attacks have temporarily downed the websites of Ukraine‚Äôs Security Service, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and government. A DDoS attack is a relatively straightforward way to quickly take a server offline. A network of internet-connected devices, either owned by the aggressor or infected with malware, floods a target with request, as if millions of users hit ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù on the same website at the same time, repeatedly. The goal is to overwhelm the server such that it isn‚Äôt able to keep up and stops replying to legitimate requests, like a user trying to access a website. Russia denied involvement with the attacks, but US and UK intelligence services have evidence they believe implicates Moscow.

Fedorov‚Äôs tweet introducing the IT Army

DDoS attacks seem to be the tool of choice for both sides, as several Russian sites, including the Kremlin‚Äôs and the Russian Military‚Äôs websites, were taken offline by a series of similar counter-attacks last week. It isn‚Äôt immediately clear whether or not these attacks came directly from the Ukrainian government or from a third party sympathetic to their cause. In order to recruit those who would help with such efforts, the government has put out calls for cybersecurity experts to help defend their country‚Äôs digital territory and launch offensive counterattacks against Russia. The first of these calls, rather strangely, came as a forum post by Yegor Aushev, the co-owner of a Kyiv-based cybersecurity firm who was said to be posting on behalf of the Defense Ministry. Later, the government launched what Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov referred to in a tweet as the country‚Äôs ‚ÄúIT Army.‚Äù This group, which is being organized via a Telegram channel, has been given lists of Russian websites and services for members to target.

The independent cybersecurity collective known as Anonymous has also decided to stand with Ukraine against Russia. They have taken credit for a variety of attacks already, including replacing the propaganda on a Russian news station, taking down Russian government and media websites, and leaking a database from the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.

Ukrainian government agencies and banks have also been targeted with malware ‚Äî specifically a virus designed to erase data from hard drives. The malicious code was identified by security firms Symantec and ESET a day before the invasion began, and Microsoft caught wind of it several hours later. After another three hours, Microsoft‚Äôs Defender software had been patched to scan for and block the package. Although there is no concrete data linking the program to Russia, they are widely believed to be the source. The attack seemingly comes without money-oriented motivation of similar malicious programs such as ransomware. When a computer is infected with ransomware, the user is usually greeted with a message that says something along the lines of ‚ÄúSend us money or all your data will be deleted.‚Äù This virus skips the middle step and simply deletes data, which implies that it was created solely to disable the infected agencies and sow confusion. To further that goal, it appears that ransomware decoys were deployed as well, either in order to shift focus away from the data-wiping virus or cover its tracks so that it could remain undetected for longer.

When stood up against what‚Äôs happening on the ground in Ukraine, all of this seems relatively benign ‚Äî who cares that a website is down while people are dying? In times of crisis, whether a war or a natural disaster, one of the most difficult and subsequently important tasks for a government is providing its citizens with potentially life-saving information. Crippling a government‚Äôs ability to disseminate such information can, at best, increase confusion and the spread of misinformation, and at worst can cause innocent people to die. In 2015, the Ukrainian power grid was famously compromised completely remotely by Russia‚Äôs Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) in an attempt to sow unrest and fear, leaving about 230,000 people without power.

Surveillance and (Social) Media

While the cyber war raging behind the scenes has been largely invisible, the rest of the war is anything but. Gone are the days when those living across the world from an active conflict get their daily dose of news from the front lines each evening at 7 PM ‚Äî social media means we‚Äôre constantly connected to a stream of information in near-realtime, although separating fact from fiction can prove difficult.

Take, for example, the ‚ÄúGhost of Kyiv‚Äù ‚Äî a mythical Ukrainian pilot said to have already shot down six Russian fighters singlehandedly. While there‚Äôs no proof that such a pilot exists (or doesn‚Äôt exist, for that matter), a popular video of the pilot taking down another plane was proven to be fake ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually footage from the video game Dynamic Combat Simulator that was taken out of context and sensationalized on Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit.

Additionally, there have been plenty of cases of willful disinformation within Moscow. The Russian government has been extremely selective in determining what information its citizens are able to consume and how they can access it. Russian media outlets were instructed to only report on information disseminated by official government sources, and the government has limited access to Facebook. Russian news stations have taken great care to paint the war (which is a banned word in itself) as a minor military operation ‚Äî although not all Russian media outlets have capitulated to the government‚Äôs demands. Tech giants have also been pressured to suppress disinformation and propaganda, most notable from Vice Prime Minister Fedorov. He‚Äôs called upon streaming services, including Netflix and YouTube, to block Russian propaganda, and other services such as PayPal and Google to disable access within Russia. Last week, YouTube disabled monetization of Russian channels.

Fedorov‚Äôs request to Musk for Starink service

Fedorov also reached out to Elon Musk over Twitter, asking for Starlink internet terminals. Musk replied by enabling Starlink‚Äôs satellite internet service in Ukraine and shipping a truckload of terminals, which arrived days ago. It‚Äôs unclear how Fedorov plans to deploy the terminals, but it‚Äôs likely that they will be used to connect hard-to-reach areas, or restore connectivity to areas with compromised infrastructure.

As you may suspect, even the most well-intentioned social media use can prove problematic in war time. Twitter users have warned each other against showing support by posting photos of the Ukraine‚Äôs defenses online to avoid providing Russian intelligence with information about troop movements or other military actions.

The advancing Russian army viewed as a traffic jam (image from Dr. Lewis‚Äôs Twitter account)

Even just carrying a smartphone can cause issues ‚Äî geolocation services make it possible for phones to be tracked, and not just by a cybersecurity expert who‚Äôs broken into Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúFind My iPhone‚Äù service.

A prime example here is the traffic jam that Dr. Lewis watched on the 24th. It was likely caused by civilians stuck behind roadblocks as the army advanced. Similarly, large gatherings such as protests or meetings in public places could be recorded displayed on Google Maps (via the ‚Äúlive busyness information‚Äù feature) and other services. To address this and protect its users, Google has temporarily disabled live traffic data in Ukraine. Even so, it may be prudent to for users to think about what kinds of data their devices log and where that data gets sent.

Looking Ahead

Even though this invasion is only a few days old, it seems to have already set a new precedent for how hybrid wars are waged, a very disquieting prospect. For many of us, watching the events unfold on our phones while sitting safely across the world from the front lines, it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of the fact that this is a very real conflict in which innocent lives are being lost each day.

All of us here at Hackaday hope for a swift, peaceful, and just resolution to the war. Screenwriter Burt Prelutsky put it perfectly while working on the script for an episode of MASH: ‚ÄúWar isn‚Äôt hell. War is war and hell is hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse‚Ä¶ there are no innocent bystanders in hell.‚Äù",1545,https://www.facebook.com/143974738982343_5018890588157376,hackaday.com,https://external-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGOVjlhw2yJizMs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhackaday.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F03%2FUkraine.jpg&ext=emg0&_nc_oe=6fb2a&_nc_sid=64c8fc&ccb=3-5&_nc_hash=AQHN__o3FLhWr_d9,Prediction unavailable,0x,https://hackaday.com/2022/03/07/the-invisible-battlefields-of-the-russia-ukraine-war/,0,FALSE,,,0,0,0,0,Istituto Radiotecnico A.
