The data contains a total of users\r\ncumulatively for each day of the series March 2 through March 11, and\r\nthe users represent participants from 98 counties.\r\nWVS/EVS\r\nI will also be using a data set of observations from the World Values\r\nSurvey conducted from 2017-2021 as a joint project between the World\r\nValues Survey and the European Values Studies. This data was released in\r\nJuly 2021, and contains responses from ~135,000 respondents among 95\r\ncountries.\r\nSpike/Newswhip\r\nThe third is a data set of media coverage (media articles and social\r\nmedia mentions) of the Ukrainian minister’s call for volunteers for the\r\n“IT Army of Ukraine” to help fight the invasion of Russia on the digital\r\nfront.\r\nBackground\r\nGathering DDOS User Data\r\nGathering WVS/EVS Data\r\nGathering Spike/Newswhip Data\r\nHypothesis\r\nI am looking at a model where the outcome is the number of DDOS\r\nattacks originated from a given country and explanatory variables are\r\nWVS activism scores, media coverage, and other controls.\r\nData Analysis\r\nDDOS Users\r\nThe data I imported for this first exploration is a data frame\r\nconsisting of 98 observations with the columns:\r\nCountry Name\r\nPopulation (as indicated by the U.S. CIA World factbook\r\nwebsite)\r\nRegion (as indicated by the UN classifications)\r\nCumulative total number of users of the DDOS attack tool from each\r\nrepresentative country as of March 11, 2022\r\n\r\n   Country            Population            Region         \r\n Length:98          Min.   :     29789   Length:98         \r\n Class :character   1st Qu.:   4948116   Class :character  \r\n Mode  :character   Median :  11768856   Mode  :character  \r\n                    Mean   :  65170210                     \r\n                    3rd Qu.:  45576742                     \r\n                    Max.   :1397897720                     \r\n     Users         \r\n Min.   :    1.00  \r\n 1st Qu.:    7.25  \r\n Median :   55.00  \r\n Mean   :  498.76  \r\n 3rd Qu.:  214.00  \r\n Max.   :13186.00  \r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 13\r\n  Country  Population Region March2 March3 March4 March5 March6 March7\r\n  <chr>         <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\r\n1 Aland         29789 North~      1      1      1      1      1      1\r\n2 Albania     3088385 South~     19     22     22     23     32     44\r\n3 Algeria    43576691 Africa      0      8      8      8      8      8\r\n4 Andorra       85645 South~      2      6      6      6      6      6\r\n5 Argenti~   45864941 South~      9      9      9     11     11     11\r\n6 Armenia     3011609 Weste~      1      7      7      9      9     13\r\n# ... with 4 more variables: March8 <dbl>, March9 <dbl>,\r\n#   March10 <dbl>, March11 <dbl>\r\n\r\nThe total DDOS users as of the first day of observations, March 2,\r\n2022, and the last day available for observation, March 11, 2022 began\r\nat 7,850 and grew to a total of 48,879.\r\n\r\n[1] 7850\r\n[1] 48879\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not going to examine the panel data; I am only going to\r\nlook at the cumulative data - or the count of users on the last day of\r\nobservations, March 11.\r\nIt is still important to be able to visualize the dramatic change in\r\nuser count over time, even if I am not analyzing the time series in this\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also want to plot the relationships between key variables of this\r\ndataset:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want to look at is the linear model of the relationship\r\nbetween the population of each country with participating users and the\r\ncorresponding sample of users from that country.\r\nI want to first simplify my data set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is no correlation between a country’s\r\npopulation and the number of users of the DDOS tool.\r\nIVS Data\r\nThe next data source I want to incorporate is the IVS data set. This\r\nbrings in an overwhelming 135,000 observations of 231 variables. I\r\nselected the columns I am interested in working with and saved as a .csv\r\nfile, which I will read in for the rest of the analysis.\r\nTo make matching easier, I used the “countrycode” package to assign\r\nproper country names to the ISO-3 numeric code from the data set.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 75\r\n  country pwght wght_eq1000 respint  A001  A002  A003  A004  A005\r\n  <chr>   <dbl>       <dbl>   <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int>\r\n1 Albania 0.140       0.697       1     2     1     2     3     2\r\n2 Albania 0.140       0.697       1     1     1     4     4     1\r\n3 Albania 0.140       0.697       1     1     2     2     4     1\r\n4 Albania 0.140       0.697       1     1     2     2     4     1\r\n5 Albania 0.140       0.697       1     1     1     2     4     1\r\n6 Albania 0.140       0.697       2     1     3     3     4     1\r\n# ... with 66 more variables: A006 <int>, A008 <int>, A009 <int>,\r\n#   A170 <int>, A173 <int>, E012 <int>, E023 <int>, E025 <int>,\r\n#   E026 <int>, E027 <int>, E028 <int>, E033 <int>, E069_01 <int>,\r\n#   E069_02 <int>, E069_04 <int>, E069_05 <int>, E069_06 <int>,\r\n#   E069_07 <int>, E069_08 <int>, E069_18A <int>, E069_18 <int>,\r\n#   E069_11 <int>, E069_12 <int>, E069_13 <int>, E069_14 <int>,\r\n#   E069_17 <int>, E069_20 <int>, E111_01 <int>, E114 <int>, ...\r\n\r\nModeling Data\r\nThere is some changes needed to make the data more manageable.

The data contains a total of users\r\ncumulatively for each day of the series March 2 through March 11, and\r\nthe users represent participants from 98 counties.\r\nAdditional data is from the IVS (Integrated Values Study); a\r\ncollaboration of the European Values Study and World Values Study.\r\nThe European Value Study (EVS) and the World Value Survey (WVS) are\r\ntwo large-scale, cross-national and repeated cross-sectional survey\r\nresearch programs. They include a large number of questions, which have\r\nbeen replicated since the early eighties.\r\nIn line with the Memorandum of Understandings, both organizations\r\nagreed to cooperate in joint data collection from 2017. EVS has been\r\nresponsible for planning and conducting surveys in European countries,\r\nusing the EVS questionnaire and EVS methodological guidelines. WVSA has\r\nbeen responsible for planning and conducting surveys in countries in the\r\nworld outside Europe, using the WVS questionnaire and WVS methodological\r\nguidelines. Five countries (Germany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and\r\nUkraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS 2017 and WVS7.\r\nBoth organizations developed their draft questionnaires\r\nindependently. The joint items define the Common Core of both\r\nquestionnaires. They are marked in yellow in the two Master\r\nQuestionnaires (EVS2017 MQ and WVS7 MQ).\r\nThe EVS archive (GESIS) has been responsible for data archiving and\r\ndata processing of the European surveys. The WVS archive (JDS Madrid)\r\nhas been responsible for data archiving and data processing for the\r\nnon-European surveys and the WVS surveys additionally conducted in\r\nGermany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Based on the Common\r\nEVS/WVS Dictionary agreed by EVS and WVS the Joint EVS/WVS 2017-2021\r\ndataset (Joint EVS/WVS) has been constructed in close collaboration.\r\nThe first version of the Joint EVS/WVS includes data and\r\ndocumentation of altogether 81 countries and territories: 35 from the\r\nEVS 2017, 51 from the WVS7. Five of these countries (Germany, Romania,\r\nRussia, Serbia, and Ukraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS and\r\nWVS.\r\nCitations\r\nEVS (2021): EVS Trend File 1981-2017.
