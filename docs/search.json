The data contains a total of users\r\ncumulatively for each day of the series March 2 through March 11, and\r\nthe users represent participants from 98 counties.\r\nAdditional data is from the IVS (Integrated Values Study); a\r\ncollaboration of the European Values Study and World Values Study.\r\nThe European Value Study (EVS) and the World Value Survey (WVS) are\r\ntwo large-scale, cross-national and repeated cross-sectional survey\r\nresearch programs. They include a large number of questions, which have\r\nbeen replicated since the early eighties.\r\nIn line with the Memorandum of Understandings, both organizations\r\nagreed to cooperate in joint data collection from 2017. EVS has been\r\nresponsible for planning and conducting surveys in European countries,\r\nusing the EVS questionnaire and EVS methodological guidelines. WVSA has\r\nbeen responsible for planning and conducting surveys in countries in the\r\nworld outside Europe, using the WVS questionnaire and WVS methodological\r\nguidelines. Five countries (Germany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and\r\nUkraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS 2017 and WVS7.\r\nBoth organizations developed their draft questionnaires\r\nindependently. The joint items define the Common Core of both\r\nquestionnaires. They are marked in yellow in the two Master\r\nQuestionnaires (EVS2017 MQ and WVS7 MQ).\r\nThe EVS archive (GESIS) has been responsible for data archiving and\r\ndata processing of the European surveys. The WVS archive (JDS Madrid)\r\nhas been responsible for data archiving and data processing for the\r\nnon-European surveys and the WVS surveys additionally conducted in\r\nGermany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Based on the Common\r\nEVS/WVS Dictionary agreed by EVS and WVS the Joint EVS/WVS 2017-2021\r\ndataset (Joint EVS/WVS) has been constructed in close collaboration.\r\nThe first version of the Joint EVS/WVS includes data and\r\ndocumentation of altogether 81 countries and territories: 35 from the\r\nEVS 2017, 51 from the WVS7. Five of these countries (Germany, Romania,\r\nRussia, Serbia, and Ukraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS and\r\nWVS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitations\r\nEVS (2021): EVS Trend File 1981-2017.
