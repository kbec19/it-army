## Purpose

This is a small study of characteristics of users of pre-made DDOS tools in the wake of Ukraine's call to create an 'IT Army' to combat disinformation by engaging in ever-changing activities directed through a Telegram channel created for the purpose.

## Data

The primary data is a set of observations of users of a novice "hacking tool" to engage in DDOS (denial of service) attacks against Russian targets in March 2022. The data contains a total of users cumulatively for each day of the series March 2 through March 11, and the users represent participants from 98 counties.

Additional data is from the IVS (Integrated Values Study); a collaboration of the European Values Study and World Values Study.

The European Value Study (EVS) and the World Value Survey (WVS) are two large-scale, cross-national and repeated cross-sectional survey research programs. They include a large number of questions, which have been replicated since the early eighties.

In line with the Memorandum of Understandings, both organizations agreed to cooperate in joint data collection from 2017. EVS has been responsible for planning and conducting surveys in European countries, using the EVS questionnaire and EVS methodological guidelines. WVSA has been responsible for planning and conducting surveys in countries in the world outside Europe, using the WVS questionnaire and WVS methodological guidelines. Five countries (Germany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS 2017 and WVS7.

Both organizations developed their draft questionnaires independently. The joint items define the Common Core of both questionnaires. They are marked in yellow in the two Master Questionnaires (EVS2017 MQ and WVS7 MQ).

The EVS archive (GESIS) has been responsible for data archiving and data processing of the European surveys. The WVS archive (JDS Madrid) has been responsible for data archiving and data processing for the non-European surveys and the WVS surveys additionally conducted in Germany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. Based on the Common EVS/WVS Dictionary agreed by EVS and WVS the Joint EVS/WVS 2017-2021 dataset (Joint EVS/WVS) has been constructed in close collaboration.

The first version of the Joint EVS/WVS includes data and documentation of altogether 81 countries and territories: 35 from the EVS 2017, 51 from the WVS7. Five of these countries (Germany, Romania, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine) conducted surveys in both waves EVS and WVS.
